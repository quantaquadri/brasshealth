									As we age, our bodies naturally lose muscle mass, which can lead to falls, type 2 diabetes, 
									osteoporosis and more. This can, in turn, lead to a lack of independence and a reduced
									 quality of life. But there is something you can do about this! Consistently participating 
									 in a strength training program is scientifically proven to reverse age-related muscle
									  loss and restore strength and functional abilities.  Having a personalized program
									   can be beneficial at any point in life, but that becomes increasingly important as we age.  
									   
									   The BrassHealth program delivers small group personal training, allows for individual attention and customized workouts at a fraction of the price of one-on-one personal training, and provides the added benefit of exercising with a supportive community. 

									   <br><br>
									BrassHealth provides an opportunity for safe, supportive, individualized exercise and 
									community-building when many gyms at this time are closed due to the coronavirus.

									BrassHealth classes are offered 6 days/week (Monday thru Saturday) throughout the day.  Our schedule is constantly evolving so please contact us if you’re inquiring about a certain day and time. We will do our best to accommodate your needs! 

 

									You have the choice of taking BrassHealth classes once, twice or three times per week.  Each class is 45 minutes long.  The science of strength training states that three times per week is ideal for increasing strength, twice per week is adequate, and once per week is more about maintenance.  Based on your own needs, you can choose any of these options. Not sure which to choose?  We are happy to talk to you and help you weigh the pros and cons of each option.  The most important part is understanding your personal goals and deciding what it will take for you to get there.

									 our BrassHealth trainers and receive instructions ahead of time with the exercises that you 
									 will do during the assessment so that you can be prepared.  These will be simple 
									 exercises, such as how many chair stands or bicep curls you can do in 30 seconds. 
									 We’ll also have a conversation about your goals, both short and long term. 
									  Once completed, you will receive a report showing your results.  
									  Fast forward 8 weeks and we’ll do the same thing again. This time, you will get a report highlighting your improvements.  Be prepared to feel really good about yourself!

									All exercise is encouraged, but as you age, having proper form is paramount to building strength and preventing injuries. To make real progress, muscles must be sufficiently challenged.

We’ve all experienced the increased motivation and accountability that comes from engaging in an activity with those we care about and who support us. We’re so convinced of the positive power of a community that if you encourage three of your friends or family members to join you and enroll as a team, each of you will receive one free month of BrassHealth and you will be able to set your own class schedule.

									The only thing you’ll need is a laptop or tablet to access the internet.  Once you sign up you’ll receive a Zoom link for the virtual training sessions. You do not need any special exercise equipment. We’ll send you a welcome kit with resistance bands and a BrassHealth water bottle to stay hydrated throughout the classes. You’ll want to wear comfortable, rubber sole shoes, be in a space where there aren’t objects on the floor that you could trip over, and have a sturdy chair on hand with no wheels.

									You don’t need experience in the gym, working with weights, or with bodyweight exercises.  Can’t tell a lunge from a squat?  Doesn’t matter. Our trainers are experts and will ensure you’re comfortable with each exercise.  We want you to reach your goals.  This is not a “no pain, no gain” zone.  This is all about creating a supportive environment that will help you create habits for life.

									We hear you.  BrassHealth is personalized for everyone and we meet you at your level.  We cap the sessions at 6 people to ensure that you will receive the individualized attention that you need to be successful.  Our coaches are experts at modifying each move to ensure that it is an exercise that you can do and feel comfortable doing.  Have an artificial knee or knee pain?  We can change a squat into a chair stand. Still bothering you?  We’ll put pillows down to make the chair higher.  Your doctor will always be the authority on whether a strength training plan is right for you, and we recommend getting clearance from your doctor prior to starting BrassHealth if you are at all concerned.

									We understand that as we age, we lose strength, balance and sometimes our confidence.  You may have a pre-existing condition or previous injury that limits your mobility.  Our trainers understand these concerns and will work with you to identify strength exercises that are appropriately challenging. We have a limit of 6 people per session for this reason – to ensure our coaches can pay close attention to everyone. And although it may be counterintuitive, strength training makes you LESS likely to get injured, not more!
